# EfficientNet-from-scratch
Build EfficientNet

This EfficientNet architecture ranges from the simplest version b0 to the "high-end" one b7. Actually, you can download 
the model directly from keras or pytorch. But if you want to add something to increase the efficiency or play around with
the architecture and its hyperparameters -> Here you are!

P/s: I built this model according to the image below. So you can easily follow along
